## Getting started in 68000 Assembler for the Atari St

Over the past year, I’ve been on a bit of a retro computing journey. It all started with the ZX Spectrum (more posts on that coming soon!), then moved to building a breadboard 8-bit computer, and now here I am with the good old Atari ST. Both the Spectrum and the Atari played a huge role in my teenage years, and diving back into them has been a fun nostalgia trip.

While I’ve spent many years as a developer, machine code was never something I really dove into. So, I’m starting this journey with a new challenge: learning 68000 assembler to eventually create a simple game for the Atari ST. First things first, I need to get familiar with the basics of 68000 assembler and understand the system.

I’ve been following various blog posts to help set up a modern development environment and explore the world of emulation. Here’s my current toolset:
	•	Visual Studio Code – for writing and editing code.
	•	Hatari Emulator – a fantastic emulator for the Atari ST.
	•	STeem Emulator – another great option for testing and tinkering.

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```

```asm
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

; There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first
